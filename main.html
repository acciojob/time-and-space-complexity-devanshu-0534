	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity help us to understand how efficient an algorithm is by anlzing how its runtime increases with input size.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> measures the memory used by an algorithm as input size increases. For Example, an algorithm with O(n) spaace complexity means the space in memory grows linearly with input size.
